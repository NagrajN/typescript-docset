# TypeScript Doc Set

This is TypeScript DocSet with some indexing. The source of this Doc Set is the Microsoft TypeScript Specification. I built it so I can use the docset with Dash on my Mac.

## Doc Set

The docset is in TypeScript.docset directory. You can add this directly in Dash or similar tooling

## Parser

The parser directory contains a simple Java Script Parser that runs on Node. To run the parser use "npm install" for required dependencies and then "node parser.js". You don't need to run the parser unless you are trying to parse a new version of the specification or if you need to extend the current indexing.

## Doc Set Sections

There are two "sections" to the Doc Set

(1) Guides: The top level breakdown as in the Specification Document,

(2) Tags: An index of almost everything that is taggable in the document.

HAPPY TYPE SCRIPTING !!!

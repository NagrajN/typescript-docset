# TypeScript Doc Set

This is TypeScript DocSet with some indexing. The source of this Doc Set is the Microsoft TypeScript Specification.

I built it so I can use the docset with Dash on my Mac

The docset is in TypeScript.docset directory. You can add this in Dash or any other tooling

The parser directory contains a simple JS parser that runs on Node. To run the parser use npm install for required dependencies.

There are two "sections" to the Doc Set
(1) Guides: The top level breakdown as in the Specification Document
(2) Tags: An index of almost everything that is taggable in the document.
